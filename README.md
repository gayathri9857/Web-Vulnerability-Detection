Create a Project
Whether you're using Windows or Linux, you can easily create a new Django project. First, open a
terminal or command prompt. On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell, and on
Linux, open your terminal. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project using the
cd command. For instance, if your desired directory is "Projects," you would type cd
path/to/your/Projects. Once you're in the correct directory, create your Django project by
running the command django-admin startproject myproject. This command will
generate a new directory called "myproject" with a specific structure.
The Project Structure
The project directory will contain several files: manage.py, a command-line utility for interacting
with your project; and a subdirectory also named "myproject," which includes
init .py (designating the directory as a Python package), settings.py (containing the
projectâ€™s configuration settings), urls.py (defining URL patterns), wsgi.py (the entry point for
WSGI-compatible web servers, used for deployment), and asgi.py (the entry point for ASGIcompatible web servers, supporting asynchronous features).
To start the development server, navigate into the "myproject" directory and run python
manage.py runserver. This command starts the server, and you can then open your web
browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see your new Django project in action. This
setup allows you to begin developing your Django application immediately.

Running a project using a `run.bat` file to start a Python server is a common practice in web
development, particularly with frameworks like Django or Flask. The `run.bat` file typically contains
commands to set up the environment, activate virtual environments (if used), and start the server.
This script automates the process, making it easier for developers to start their applications
consistently.
When you double-click on `run.bat`, it initiates the Python server, which listens for incoming HTTP
requests on a specified port, commonly 8000. Once the server is running, you may see a confirmation
message or a command prompt indicating that the server has started, as illustrated in Fig. 7.1.
To interact with the application, you open a web browser and navigate to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html`. Here, `127.0.0.1` refers to the local machine, and `8000` is the
port where the Python server is listening. This URL loads the `index.html` page hosted by the local
server. This setup allows developers to test their web applications locally before deployment,
ensuring everything works as expected in a controlled environment.
